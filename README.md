# UX for AI Design Principles

A repository containing principles, guidelines, patterns, and resources for designing user experiences for AI-powered features and products.

## Vision & Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive, evolving framework for practitioners creating user-centered experiences involving Artificial Intelligence. As AI capabilities advance, particularly towards more agentic systems, new UX challenges and opportunities arise. This repository aims to capture best practices, define key concepts, and offer practical guidance to navigate this complex design space effectively and responsibly.

## Target Audience

This framework is intended for anyone involved in the creation of AI-powered products, including:

*   **UX Designers & Researchers:** Seeking principles, patterns, and methods specific to AI interactions.
*   **Content Designers:** Crafting clear, effective language for AI interactions and documentation.
*   **Product Managers:** Looking for frameworks to guide feature development and prioritization in AI.
*   **Engineers & Developers:** Interested in the UX implications of different AI implementations.
*   **Students & Educators:** Exploring the field of Human-AI Interaction and UX design for emerging technologies.

## Structure & Contents

This repository is organized to provide structured guidance on various facets of AI UX design. Key areas include:

*   **Agentic AI Principles (Wiki):** A detailed collection of documents exploring the nuances of designing for AI agents that can act autonomously on behalf of users. This includes key attributes, UI patterns, interaction styles, trust & safety considerations, and implementation strategies. [**Access the Agentic AI Wiki Here**](wiki) *(Assuming wiki is at the standard `/wiki` path)*
*   **(Future Sections):** This repository may expand to cover other areas of AI UX beyond agentic systems.

## How to Use This Framework

*   **Explore by Topic:** Navigate the wiki or repository structure based on your area of interest (e.g., Trust & Safety, UI Patterns).
*   **Reference for Design:** Use the principles and guidelines during your design process to inform decisions and provoke thought.
*   **Foundation for Discussion:** Leverage the concepts and terminology to facilitate conversations within your team about AI UX challenges.

## Current Status

This project is **actively maintained** but considered a **living document**. The principles and guidelines will evolve as the field of AI UX matures and based on community feedback.
