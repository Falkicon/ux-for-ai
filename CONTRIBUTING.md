# Contributing to UX for AI Design Principles

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the UX for AI Design repository! Your feedback and suggestions are valuable as we aim to create a comprehensive and useful resource for the community.

We primarily manage contributions and feedback through GitHub Issues.

## How You Can Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute:

*   **Provide Feedback on Wiki Content:** If you find errors, have suggestions for improvement, or think something is unclear in the [Agentic AI Wiki](wiki) or other documentation, please let us know!
*   **Report General Issues:** If you encounter problems with the repository structure, links, or have general suggestions not tied to a specific wiki page.
*   **Suggest Enhancements:** Propose new topics, sections, or principles you think would be valuable additions.

## Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub Issues to track all feedback, suggestions, and potential errors.

1.  **Check Existing Issues:** Before submitting, please quickly check the [existing issues](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/issues) <!-- TODO: Replace USERNAME/REPO_NAME with actual path --> to see if your point has already been raised or discussed.
2.  **Create a New Issue:** If your point is new, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/issues/new/choose) <!-- TODO: Replace USERNAME/REPO_NAME with actual path -->.
3.  **Use Templates:** Please use the provided Issue Templates (`Wiki Feedback` or `General Issue/Suggestion`) if applicable, as they help structure the information effectively.
4.  **Be Clear and Specific:**
    *   If reporting an error or providing feedback on the wiki, please **link directly to the specific wiki page** you are referencing.
    *   Clearly describe the issue or suggestion.
    *   Explain *why* you think a change is needed or would be beneficial.
    *   Provide examples if possible.

## Suggestions for New Content

If you have ideas for entirely new sections, principles, or documents, please open a `General Issue/Suggestion` issue first to discuss the proposal. This allows for discussion before significant effort is potentially invested.

## Direct Contributions (Code/Content)

Currently, we prioritize contributions via feedback and suggestions through the Issue tracker. If you are interested in making direct contributions to the content (e.g., writing new sections, significant revisions), please start by opening an issue to discuss your proposed contribution with the maintainers.
